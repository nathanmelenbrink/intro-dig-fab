		<h3> Assignment 10.0: Portfolio </h3>
	</div >

	<div class="small-12 medium-12 large-9  columns">
		<h3> Description: </h3>
		<p> Produce a portfolio website that will be useful to you after this class! For most people this will mean reformatting and polishing your current page. Alternatively, you can build a new website, or modify an existing portfolio page to include work done for this class. </p>

		<p> This is due by the end of the semester (Apr 27th), and counts as your final weekly assignment. However, it's my hope that you'll be motivated not by the prospect of getting a good grade, but rather by the prospect of landing a good job/internship/co-op in your field of interest.  </p>

		<h3> Requirements: </h3>
		<p> 	
			 Your website must at least include all of the following features:
			 <ul>
			 	<li>Be clearly identifiable as a personal portfolio website, showcasing your coding abilities but catered towards your own interests. </li>
			 	<li> Include at least three projects you submitted as weekly assignments (you may include all of them if you wish). </li>
			 	<li> Include a link to your group's final project page (it's a good idea to concisely state your role in the project). </li>
			 	<li> Remove words like "exercise", "assignment", and "ARTG2260", and instead use whatever language is most natural for you to talk about your work.  </li> 
			 	<li> Include an "About" page or something similar (you should already have this). This should contain your CV/resume, either in HTML or as a downloadable file (remember the <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_download.asp'>download attribute</a>). </li> 
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3> Hacker Points: </h3>
		<p> 	
			  Complete your choice of the following features (or all) to get bonus points in the assignment:
			 <ul>
			 	<li> Include creative work you've done on your own or in other courses </li> 
				<li> Create a novel user experience (as opposed to the familiar list or grid layouts often used for portfolio sites). E.g., <a href='../resources/bennet-engler_zack'> navigation via mini-games </a>. </li>
				
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3> Submission: </h3>
		<p> Commit and push your changes to your website before midnight on the due date. If your URL is different from the URL you've used in class so far, make sure to notify me (email nathanmelenbrink -at- gmail -dot- com). That's all! Have a nice summer!
