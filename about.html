<a href='./kit.html'>SC 102 Lab Inventory (Work in Progress) </a><br> 


<h3> Course Description</h3>
<p> A hands-on introduction to rapid prototyping, integrating physics and engineering, design, computer science and art. Students will learn to safely use software and hardware to fabricate programmable projects. Tools and topics will include electronic circuit design, 3D CAD, programmable microcontrollers, and wireless networking (Internet of Things). Additionally, students will learn operational principles for techniques such as laser cutting, 3D printing, and computer-controlled milling. Applications may include personal fabrication, product prototyping, fine arts and the creation of scientific research tools. The course will culminate with an individual final project, integrating as many of the weekly topics as possible. Each student will document work on each weekly topic in a personal website, thereby finishing the course with an online portfolio that not only illustrates their new skill sets, but also contributes to a collective repository of knowledge that serves as a foundation for continued learning. </p>

<p> Prerequisites: There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, basic computer literacy (word processing, online search skills, etc.) is expected. Students are expected to bring their own laptop computer. </p> 

<h3> Lecture </h3>
<p>Students are expected to arrive on time and to be prepared to participate in class activities. During class, material will be presented using a combination of lecture and in-class activities, so preparation is essential. For a further explanation of summer school policies around attendance and participation, see <a herf='http://www.summer.harvard.edu/resources-policies/student-responsibilities'>student responsibilities </a>
</p>

<h3> Supervised Lab Time </h3>

<p> Students are required to take advantage of provided supervised lab times to work on their assignments and final project. Attendance is mandatory; all assignments require some amount of lab work and there will be no possibility of working in the lab without supervision. As per Harvard Summer School recommendations, students are expected to do at least 8–12 hours of work per week outside of class time. For this course, 6 of those hours will come from 3-hour supervised lab times (twice weekly), while additional coursework such as web documentation may be done outside of the lab. For each lab session, students should take care to: </p>

<ul>
	<li> Wear lab safety glasses or goggles (if you do not have a pair, you can borrow one from the lab)</li>
	<li> Wear comfortable clothing and closed-toe and heel shoes</li>
	<li> Read through the relevant documentation and have a plan for using lab time wisely</li>
</ul>

<p> <b> Sections:</b> On the first course meeting, students will be divided into two groups for supervised lab time: either 12-3pm Mondays and Wednesdays, or 3:15-6:15 Wednesdays and Fridays.  Ideally groups will be equally sized at 12 or 13 students each. We will make sure to accommodate anyone who has a scheduling conflict with one of the offered times. 
</p>

<p> <b>Conflicts:</b> There will be no make-up supervised lab-times. If students are not able to make their scheduled lab time, they may arrange with a course TA to attend another section’s lab time.</p>

<p> <b> Grading:</b> Attendance of supervised lab time will count towards the 20% participation grade.   </p>


<h3>Assessment</h3>
<p> Students will be assessed on the basis of website documentation (60%), the documentation and presentation of the final project (20%) and attendance and participation (20%). Only work that is documented on the personal page will be considered for grading. Students taking the course for graduate credit will be given the same assignments, but with higher expectations for assignment sophistication and documentation (see below). 
</p>

<b>Documentation:</b> Thorough documentation on your personal page is required in order to earn full credit for assignments (60% of total grade). You will have one week to complete each assignment (i.e., assignments given on a Tuesday are due the next Tuesday). 

A well-documented assignment is one that provides sufficient information for someone else to fully recreate your project. At a minimum this requires photographs, screenshots, and a thorough written description of the steps taken, and may also require code snippets, movies, 3D models and/or links to outside resources. Here is an example of a <a href='https://momran2401.github.io/portfolio/PHYSCI-70/elecInput.html'>well-documented assignment</a>. Instructors will provide examples and precedents for each assignment. Documentation will be assessed throughout the semester, and instructors will provide mid-term feedback. 

Assignment documentation grades are out of 5. Scores indicate the following:

	- 3: you completed the minimal in-class example and documented it well.
	- 4: you went beyond the minimal assignment and documented it well.
	- 4.5: you made an excellent project with excellent documentation.
	- 5: impressive to the point of overachieving. (This is a very high bar that is awarded very infrequently).

Midterm feedback will be provided. Notes on midterm feedback: 

If you're scoring 4s and 4.5s, you're likely on track to get an A/A-/B+. (Provisional grades do not include participation or final projects.)

If you have no score for a given assignment, that means we weren't able to find your documentation (maybe a broken link). If you have a very low score, you might have images or other assets failing to load properly (remember .png is not the same as .PNG). Make sure to check your page from a different computer and different browser to make sure it's working for everyone.

You have until the last day of the exam period to make revisions to your website. At the end of the semester, we'll ask you to let us know if we should re-grade any of your assignments. We will give up to a 4.5 for late revisions.

Unfortunately, we do not have time to haggle over individual assignment grades. If you're not happy with the grades you received, remember that grades are improved by going well beyond the in-class examples, trying more than one thing, and adding more assets to your documentation. 

<p><b>Final Project:</b> Students are asked to present an idea for a final project at the start of the semester, which is expected to evolve over the duration of the course. Students will have weekly opportunities for advising on final project ideation. Final projects should integrate most of the skills covered over the semester, including at a minimum:</p>

<ul> 
	<li> 3D design and fabrication (either mold/cast, 3D print, lasercut, etc.)</li>
	<li> Electronics (input and output)</li>
	<li> Microcontroller programming</li>
</ul>
