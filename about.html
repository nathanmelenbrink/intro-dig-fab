		<h3> Course Description</h3>
		<p> This course is a hands-on introduction to rapid prototyping, integrating physics, engineering, design, computer science, and art. Students learn to safely use software and hardware to fabricate programmable projects in a collaborative environment. Tools and topics include shop safety, hand tools, laser cutter, 3D printer, computer-controlled milling, electronic circuit design, programmable microcontrollers, molding, and casting. Applications include personal fabrication, product prototyping, fine arts, and creation of scientific research tools. Biweekly class meetings consist of a discussion of the previous assignment, a short lecture on the next topic, and a hands-on training session for the accompanying assignment. The course culminates with an individual final project, integrating as many of the topics as possible. In addition to class meetings there are supervised lab times to work on assignments. Each student documents work on each biweekly topic in a personal website, thereby finishing the course with an online portfolio that not only illustrates their new skill sets, but also contributes to a collective repository of knowledge. Although no fabrication expertise is required, the open-ended nature of the course would make it valuable for students with any amount of prior experience.</p>

		<h3> Lecture </h3>
		<p>Students are expected to arrive on time and to be prepared to participate in class activities. During class, material will be presented using a combination of lecture and in-class activities, so preparation is essential. For a further explanation of summer school policies around attendance and participation, see <a herf='http://www.summer.harvard.edu/resources-policies/student-responsibilities'>student responsibilities </a>
		</p>
 
 		<h3> Supervised Lab Time </h3>
		<p>Students are required to take advantage of provided supervised lab times to work on their assignments and final project. Attendance is mandatory; all assignments require some amount of lab work and there will be no possibility of working in the lab without supervision. As per Harvard Summer School recommendations, students are expected to do at least 8–12 hours of work per week outside of class time. For this course, 6 of those hours will come from 3-hour supervised lab times (twice weekly), while additional coursework such as web documentation may be done outside of the lab. For each lab session, students should take care to:  </p>
	
		<ul> 
			<li> Wear lab safety glasses or goggles (if you do not have a pair, you can borrow one from the lab)</li>
			<li> Wear comfortable clothing and closed-toe and heel shoes</li>
			<li> Read through the relevant documentation and have a plan for using lab time wisely</li>
		</ul>

		<p><b>Sections:</b> On the first course meeting, students will be divided into two groups for supervised lab time: either 12-3pm Mondays and Wednesdays, or 3:15-6:15 Wednesdays and Fridays. Ideally groups will be equally sized at 7 or 8 students each. We will make sure to accommodate anyone who has a scheduling conflict with one of the offered times.</p>

		<p><b>Conflicts:</b> There will be no make-up supervised lab-times. If students are not able to make their scheduled lab time, they may arrange with a course TA to attend another section’s lab time.</p>
		
		<p><b>Grading:</b> Attendance of supervised lab time will count towards the 20% participation grade
		</p>

		<h3>Assessment</h3>
		<p> Students will be assessed on the basis of website documentation (60%), the documentation and presentation of the final project (20%) and attendance and participation (20%). Only work that is documented on the personal page will be considered for grading.</p>

		<p><b>Documentation:</b> Thorough documentation on your personal page is required in order to earn full credit for assignments (60% of total grade). A well-documented assignment is one that provides sufficient information for someone else to fully recreate your project. At a minimum this requires photographs, screenshots, and a thorough written description of the steps taken, and may also require code snippets, movies, 3D models and/or links to outside resources. Here is an example of a <a href='http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.14/people/andrew_mao/week6/'>well-documented assignment</a>. Instructors will provide examples and precedents for each assignment. Documentation will be assessed throughout the semester, and instructors will provide mid-term feedback. </p>

		<p><b>Final Project:</b> Students are asked to present an idea for a final project at the start of the semester, which is expected to evolve over the duration of the course. Students will have weekly opportunities for advising on final project ideation. Final projects should integrate most of the skills covered over the semester, including at a minimum:</p>

		<ul> 
			<li> 3D design and fabrication (either mold/cast, 3D print, lasercut, etc.)</li>
			<li> Electronics (input and output)</li>
			<li> Microcontroller programming</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- <h3> Course Forum </h3>
		<p>
		This  <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/artg-2260-spring-2018-02' >Google Group</a> will be used for announcements and all other communications outside of class. Most importantly, you should use this group as a forum for help with assignments. You will all likely find yourselves stuck many times with problems or concepts you don’t fully understand. Relax -- this is a good sign. Programming is challenging, and getting stuck just means that you’re pushing the boundaries of your knowledge. I won’t be able to hold conventional office hours, so we’ll use this Google Group as a collective resource for troubleshooting. So if you’re stuck or have a question about the assignment, simply post your question to the group. Don’t be shy about posting; you’re probably not the only one who’s having the same issue. Once your question is answered, your classmates may be grateful to see it as a reference. The idea is that your questions will be answered not only by me, but also by your fellow classmates. This will reflect very positively on your participation grade. </p>

		<p> Questions that are clear, descriptive and well-phrased yield good replies. There is an example of a well-posed question on the forum. As should go without saying, the forum is an extension of the classroom, and University conduct policies still apply. Practice good forum etiquette. Help each other out, no trolling, keep cat GIFs to a minimum, etc. </p>
 -->

		<!-- <h3> Grading</h3>
		<p>
			The overall grade you will earn in this course will be based on the following: </p>
			<uL>
				<li>10% Active participation in presentation, discussion, forum, and workshop sessions 
				<li>10% In-class Exercises
				<li>45% Weekly Assignments 
				<li>35% Final Project 
			</uL>
		<p>	
			In-class exercises are graded for completion. For weekly assignments as well as the final assignment, half the grade is earned by demonstrating the technical requirements, while the other half is earned through efforts put towards a styling and aesthetic composition. If you have any questions about how your grade was determined, don’t hesitate to ask. 

		</p> -->

		<!-- <h3> Time Management</h3>
		<p>	Expect to spend a considerable amount of time outside of class working on your assignments. Learning to code requires a tremendous amount of time and dedication. Inexplicable errors can pop up at any moment; therefore, the sooner you can begin working on your assignment, the more time you'll have to deal with unexpected setbacks. I strongly encourage you to try to finish Exercises in class, and start on Assignments within a day of class. If you start with the content fresh in your mind, it’ll take you less time overall to finish the work. </p> -->

		<!-- <h3> Use of 3rd Party Code</h3>
		<p>You are expected to write original code for your weekly and final assignments. You must be able to explain the overall functionality of your program, as well as the utility of any line of code contained within. You are encouraged to consult faculty, students, or outside resources for help with coding, debugging and design. You are further encouraged to help other students in class, on the forum, and otherwise. Outside resources may include code examples and third-party libraries found online. It's fine to use such resources to simplify your code, but you should show your comprehension of the third-party functionality by writing detailed comments in the code. Furthermore, it is your responsibility to ensure that any open source materials in your work are properly attributed. If there is substantial reason to believe that the work you've submitted is neither fully your own nor properly attributed to its original source, this will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Complaint Resolution. </p> -->
