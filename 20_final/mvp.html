		<h3> Description: </h3>

		<p> Due by <b>midnight, Wednesday, March 28th</b>. By now you should have settled on a final project idea. The assignment for this week is to develop that idea as much as possible in the next week. This should result in a <a href='https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27809/minimum-viable-product-mvp'>Minimum Viable Product</a>. In other words, it should demonstrate the basic functionality you proposed. It's fine to use placeholder text, images, etc. The important thing is that you have a functional, published application by next week.  </p>

		<h3> Requirements: </h3>
		<p> 	
			 Your MVP application must at least include all of the following features:
			 <ul>
			 	<li> A README file for your repo that contains a project description, group member names, and credits for any tutorials or code used. </li>
			 	<li> State your MVP goals and stretch goals in the README </li>
			 	<li> Add an "About" page for your project (or some way of describing the project). You should consider that the text and images you use to describe the project should serve the purposes of presenting the project live, as well as describing the project to online visitors. This is a <a href='https://sharing-economy-cs171.herokuapp.com/'>great example</a> of a clearly communicated project that uses the <a href='https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#page1'>fullPage.js</a> library to organize content </li>
			 	<li> Successful implementation and demonstration of all libraries and APIs you plan to use </li>
			 	<li> Draft page layouts including all UI elements (sliders, text inputs, buttons, etc.) that you plan to use </li>
 				<li> Pseudo-code written as stand-in comments for features you've not yet had a chance to implement </li>
 				<li> No bugs! </li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3> Submission: </h3>
		<p> Upload your work by <b>midnight, Wednesday, March 28th</b> to your shared GitHub repository. As always, please reach out via the forum if you get stuck with anything. </p>
