		<h3> Presentation: </h3>
		<p> We will all gather to present our final projects to each other and to a distinguished guest jury on the evening of April 5th, 2018 at 6pm sharp. This is the most important deadline of the semester, and you are expected to have developed your project to a presentable stage. Please expect to stay for the duration, which will likely go until 8:30pm. Each group will present their project (appx. 10 minutes), after which the guest jurors will have the chance to critique the project and ask you further questions ranging from general project goals to the details of implementation. You are always encouraged to join the discussion and pose questions to your peers. </p>

		<p> Our guests will include: 
			<ul> 
				<li> Nic Carey, Roboticist, Artist, Harvard University </li>
				<li> Varvara Toulkeridou, Senior Research Engineer, Generative Design Specialist, Autodesk</li>
				<li> Jackson Howell, Lead Front-end Developer, GARP </li>
				<li> Celia Pearce, Head of Game Design Program, CAMD NEU </li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p> You are expected to prepare and deliver an introductory presentation and demonstration of your project to the class. Try to make your presentation concise to leave time for your demo. The presentation should be hosted on your project website (e.g on the about page) and should answer the following questions. Try to use images instead of text when possible. For example, use screen shots of reference projects instead of lengthy descriptions. </p> 


	<ul>
		<li> Introduction / Overview: What's the project title and tagline? </li>
		<li> Motivation: Whatâ€™s the problem or issue you want to address?</li>
		<li> Related Work: What are some similar projects? </li>
		<li> Novelty: What are the main features that make your project unique? </li>  
		<li> Challenges: What were the new things you had to learn to complete the assignment? Avoid telling an origin story.  </li>
		<li> Next Steps: What do you intend to do with your remaining time? </li>
	</ul>


	<p> The purpose of this presentation is to elicit feedback for the benefit of your projects. Please try to use this opportunity wisely. Designate someone to take notes on the feedback. Arrange a group meeting shortly after the presentations to formulate a plan for how to revise your projects in response to the feedback. The degree to which you're able to incorporate feedback from the guest jurors (and from you peers) will be reflected in your final grade. </p>

		<p>Finally, please make sure your GitHub readme file contains a link to your GitHub page, and vice versa. </p>
