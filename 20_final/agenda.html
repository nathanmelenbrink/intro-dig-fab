## Final Presentations

PHYS S-12 Final Presentations will be held in SC 102 on <b>Thursday August 3rd from 12-1:30pm</b>. Please feel free to invite friends and family. Refreshments will be provided. [Here are some photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M5QVWG3C8wiwpNNJJ7rVxEgSCEu8z2n0?usp=drive_link) from previous project fairs. 

### Presentation Format 

We will share our work in a "project fair" format, where everyone will have a chance to present their work to anyone who comes by. 

- Please have your class website open on a laptop (or other display). Be ready to demo your final project as best you can. Also, include any weekly assignments that you're proud of, especially kinetic sculptures. 
- Your grade is mostly based on your documentation and scope of work, but also on your presentation, to a lesser extent. Certain anonymous guest critics will be among the crowd, and they will have the chance to tell the teaching staff who they thought had the most impressive projects and presentations. 
- In addition to being required for the class, project fairs are a great opportunity to meet people and find future opportunities. Don't be shy! 
- Take some time to see the other projects in the class, but plan to spend most of the 1.5 hours by your work.
