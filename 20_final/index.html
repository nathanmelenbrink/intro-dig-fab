		<h3> Description</h3>
		<p> We will spend the last weeks of this course focused on a collective final project. Over the course of the semester you will propose and refine topics based on your own interest. You’ll then be placed into groups of 3 based on shared interests and different backgrounds. You should then develop a complete, coherent design project worthy of the cover of your portfolio. This is the most important part of this course, and we should put considerable effort into it. </p>

		<p> As a group, you will formulate objectives and success criteria for your Final Project. You are expected to go beyond merely building a cool visualization or a fun game. Instead, your project should develop around a central research question or hypothesis. For example, if you wish to develop an app for civic engagement, how will you test whether it's successful? While making a game just for fun is prohibited as a Final Project idea, gamification of another concept (e.g. child development, civic engagement) is encouraged. 
		</p>


<!-- 		<h3> Requirements: </h3>
		<p>  Your Final Project must at least include all of the following features: 
			<ul>
				<li>A header section in the form of a multiline comment, specifying the class name, your name, your email, and your choice of title. Also include citations for any tutorials, references, etc.  </li>
				<li>Fully functional code that surpasses the MVP goals</li>
				<li>Attention to styling and aesthetic refinement</li>
				<li>A 7-minute presentation, including a slide deck (see below), as well as either a live demo or pre-recorded video</li>
			</ul>
		</p> -->

		<h3> Components: </h3>
		<p> Remember, the Final Project makes up 35% of your final grade.

<!-- 		<p> If you have any questions about how your grade is determined, don’t hesitate to ask. The general criteria for grades is as follows:
			<ul>
				<li> A: Outstanding achievement, exceptional effort and work in all respects, clearly stands out in comparison to other work, all deliverables submitted on time and complete, programming solution is functional, aesthetically coherent and with style, well documented, and without any bugs.  </li>
				<li> B: Good achievement, above average effort and work, all deliverables submitted on time and complete, programming solution is functional, aesthetically coherent, well documented, and without any serious bugs.    </li>
				<li> C: Satisfactory achievement, average effort and work, some or all deliverables submitted on time, may or may not be complete, programming solution is for the most part functional, aesthetically coherent, documented, and without any catastrophic bugs. </li>
				<li> D: Poor achievement, incomplete deliverables submitted late or on time, programming solution is not functional, and/or aesthetically incoherent and/or exhibits catastrophic bugs.   </li>
				<li> F: Failure.  </li>
			</ul>
		</p> -->
		<h3> Submission: </h3>
		<p> The Final Project will require you to jump into the collaborative features of GitHub. One member of your group should create a new repository for the Final Project, and invite your group members (and also me) as collaborators. The code from the final commit to your group repository before the deadline will be considered the final submission.  </p>
