		<h3> Description: </h3>
		<p> <b> Due Monday, 2/26 11:59pm!</b> For this stage of the Final Project, you should work with your partners to develop three distinct proposals for your group's Final Project. This can include any combination of your individual ideas, but should be further developed to answer the following questions: 
			<ul> 
				<li> What is your research question? </li>
				<li> What are you seeking to discover? </li>
				<li> What is your metric for success? </li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>	Remember that you have multiple team members and over a month to work on this project. Make sure your proposals are appropriately ambitious. Aim high -- it's a lot easier to scale down an over-ambitious idea than to scale up an underwhelming one. You should write a paragraph for each proposal, ordered by preference (put your collective favorite idea first). Proposals should be distinct (not just variations of each other). You may include images or references if it helps to convey your ideas. </p>

<!-- 		Redistricting Program
In talks about how America will deal with the issue of partisan gerrymandering one of the more intriguing ideas is to leave redistricting to a program, something without partisan bias. I would love to put the idea that a program can not be partisan to the test by creating one of these redistricting programs. Although this of course has been made before, I would want one that demonstrates how different variables can change the outcomes. It could also be expanded to state and even national levels, counties being redrawn to follow some rule. This would be difficult and might be out of the scope of this class, there's a lot of data that needs to be stored for this to work, but I think it's still and interesting idea that I would want to try out. -->

		<h3> Submission: </h3>
		<p> Post your text to a new thread on the forum, with the first names of the group members as the subject heading by Monday, 2/26 11:59pm.  </p>
