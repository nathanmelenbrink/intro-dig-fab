		<h3> Description </h3>
		<p> In this assignment, you are asked to individually collect at least 3 precedent projects that you find interesting or inspiring, write a review of them, and publish it to the Google Group. Afterwards, browse the submissions of your fellow classmates and post feedback on at least one other person’s findings. This assignment is intended to get you all collectively thinking about the possibilities available to you for Final Projects, and to start to see where your interests align with those of your classmates. 	
		</p>

		<h3>Requirements:</h3>
		<p> You may consider categories such as games, input devices, output devices, public art, generative art, civic engagement, community building, etc. Your precedents can all be from the same category, or from different categories. It’s not necessary that the precedents you choose were created in p5 or Processing. You may search <a href='https://www.openprocessing.org/'>Open Processing</a>, <a href='https://processing.org/exhibition/'>Processing Exhibition</a>, or other collections (though please don’t select all of your precedents from one source). YouTube, Vimeo, etc. are good places to look, as are design blogs like https://www.awwwards.com/ </p>

		<h3>Submision:</h3>
		<p> For each of your 3 precedent projects, write a one-paragraph review and include a link and a reference image that describes the project. Post to the Google Group with the subject line "firstname_precedents". Afterwards, browse the submissions of your fellow classmates and post feedback on at least one other person’s findings. </p>
