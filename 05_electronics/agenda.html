<h3> Assignment: </h3>
<p> 
1. Program a microcontroller to produce an output using at least one button for input. Include a conditional statement and a <code>for()</code> loop.<br><br>

<!-- 2. Find a tutorial for Fusion360 and create a simple 3D model. For example: <br>  
	<a href='https://f360ap.autodesk.com/courses/getting-started-in-fusion-360/lessons/lesson-1-course-overview' >Autodesk Intro for Beginners</a><br> 
	<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0bhdr84FNU' >Designing a 3D Printed Enclosure for Arduino Uno </a><br>
	<a href='https://youtu.be/3PnKBSOulwo?list=PLmA_xUT-8UlL23teEbhgeU4-3FE8pprpK' >Design a 3D Printed Lampshade</a><br>
	<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGtNLpYSXOU' >Design a Coin with Logo</a><br><br> -->

2. Think about your final project and any additional components you might want. Start working on the 3D design for your project, especially components you might want to be lasercut or 3D printed. We can't make any promises, but we will do our best to accommodate requests within reason. Next Tuesday the 13th is the deadline for requests, in order for us to print/cut, mail, and get to you in time for you to assemble your project. (This will also be your assignment for next class). Please feel free to send us your designs prior to that for feedback. Please also feel free to use models from this <a href='https://myhub.autodesk360.com/ue2d91ec7/g/projects/20200416287494476/data/dXJuOmFkc2sud2lwcHJvZDpmcy5mb2xkZXI6Y28uQVRUTWVrMFRSNzZJQUpxbjh5cFB5Zw'>collection of 3D models of kit components</a>, or from other online collections like 
<a href='https://grabcad.com/'>grabcad.com</a> or <a href='https://www.thingiverse.com/'>Thingiverse</a>.

</p>

<h3> Lab Sections:</h3> 
<p> Work on microcontroller programming. <br> 
	Discuss final projects and 3D modeling requirements. <br>
	Download and install <a href='https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/'>Prusa Slicer Software</a>, and configure it for the MK3S model printer. Prepare a 3D model for printing.
</p>

<h3> Readings:</h3> 
<p> Read chapters 5-6 of <a href='http://mars1980.github.io/resources/making_things_move.pdf' >Making Things Move</a>. Make a note of some of the more interesting points you learn. </p>

<h3> Resources: </h3>

This is incomplete and imperfect, but may still be helpful. If you've modeled compoonents that aren't included, please message us with the email address you used for Fusion360, so we can add you as a contributor to this collection. <br>
